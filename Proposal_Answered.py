#Maria's super intense and super cool visual novel

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

#A visual novel that has a murder mystery story and minigames throughout in order to find the killer

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

#I will use Renpy to create a murder mystery visual novel. Ideally, the visual novel will include both background and character art, background music, mini games that bring the player closer to the killer, multiple character types that the player can interact with and create relationships with, and jumpscares during key moments of the game.

#To make my visual novel, I'll need to familarize myself with Renpy and how exactly I can incorporate mini games into my game. I also need to learn how to impliment music as well.
