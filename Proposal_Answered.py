# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

# Something like LuckyLoop or another cool game name

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

# A roguelike blackjack game where the player plays against the house with changing odds each level

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

# The game will let the player play blackjack against the house using graphics from Pygame. 
#Each level will increase in difficulty by modifying the odds, dealer behavior, or other game mechanics.
#Players can choose skills that change gameplay, for example revealing dealer cards, improving win chances, or earning extra rewards ( I haven't decided yet. 
#Random encounters could occur each round, introducing modifiers or challenges similar to roguelike mechanics. 
#Visuals will include cards, a table background, and clickable buttons for game actions. 
# I also want to include sound effects and background music if i have time.
#I'll be logging player performance into a CSV file, and I'll use RStudio to collect and visualize statistics like win rate,
#average balance, and how players are progressing in levels.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

# I'm not combining with another final project, but I am using RStudio to compile stats that the player can see. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

#N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

# A working blackjack game where the player can hit, stand, and double down, levels that increase in difficulty, basic logging of game results to a CSV.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

# Implement roguelike elements like player skills and random encounters each round, have visuals for cards and a table using Pygame with clickable buttons for actions, Basic sound effects for game events, and an RStudio analysis with plots for win rate and balance progression.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

# Smooth animations for dealing cards and transitions between rounds, Background music and enhanced sound effects, Dynamic odds adjustment per level with increasingly complex modifiers, anf a complete stats dashboard in RStudio.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

# I feel like there might be complicated mechanics to this, so as a beginner coder, I'll have to learn how to use things like PyGame to create the best game possible.
# I also need to research how to implement roguelike mechanics, including skills and random encounters, within the blackjack game framework
# I also need to learn how to play sounds and background music.
# For statistics, I'll have to aggregate and visualize gameplay data in RStudio, creating plots that show win rate, balance over time, and the impact of player skills
# After building the base game, I'll add things like modifiers and level progression.
