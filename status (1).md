Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far, I have the rough visuals that I've downloaded, Background music, and a card sound effect. I also have rough game loop with hit, stand, and double buttons. For actual game mechanics, I have a skill screen where players choose a skill to give them an edge over the house. Each level has 5 rounds. I also have a section of my code that creates a CSV file and collects player data that I will use later to create graphs (but they might not look the best with such little data).

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still need to work on the UI to improve the visuals, perfect the Blackjack gameplay so it makes sense, and include more roguelike aspects like skills rolling over to the next level or the next game. I'd also like to add a title screen and a game-over screen to bring it all together. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I've already had problems with bugs and needed help debugging my code. The game is very intricate because I really wanted it to act like an actual roguelike and not just a Blackjack game, which makes it more complicated because it has many interconnected functions.
